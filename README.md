# TactileDecisionEEG

This repository includes the Matlab scripts I created for analyzing EEG data from a tactile decision task. The scripts allow to analyze the timelock and time frequency response as a function of task difficulty. This scripts were created to run on Matlab 2013a and FieldTrip version 20141231.
